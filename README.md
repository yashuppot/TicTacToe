# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python and tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI).

## Features

- Customizable board size: You can choose the size of the game board, making it suitable for larger or smaller grids.
- Player vs. Player: Play against a friend locally on the same computer.
- Win Detection: The game detects when a player wins by getting three symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
- Draw Detection: If all cells are filled and no player wins, the game is declared a draw.
- Reset Option: Start a new game anytime by clicking the "Reset" button.

## How to Play

1. Run the `tictactoe.py` script.
2. Enter the size of the Tic-Tac-Toe board when prompted.
3. Click on any empty cell to place your symbol (X or O).
4. The game automatically switches players after each move.
5. The game ends when a player wins, or it's a draw.
6. Click the "Reset" button to start a new game.
